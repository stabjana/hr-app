### Reflection

I practiced to set up the React environment, to write code in jsx and work with the file system. I also learned how easy you can forget to import or export the files. I learned how to use useState and how to handle events in jsx. In this example we made a button with an onClick event. I learned how to set up the usual html page layout with header, footer and main.
